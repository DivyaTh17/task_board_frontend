Hello All!
This is a React project for creating a dashboard which add tasks according to three sorting definations:
1. To Do
2. Doing
3. Done
User can view their task in these three columns.
Hope you like it! :D

Documenting how I did this: 
1. Started working with a design in mind. 
2. As I wanted to stick to basics, I did not use NextJS. Although, I am planning to use it later just to learn.
3. I wanted an organised file structure, so I created a folder for all components and screens.
4. First I made a homepage with 3 columns as required and then made a "add" button on top right corner to pop open a modal with form for required tasks.
5. Saving this form, will map the the task with the column as selected in the form. 
6. The same task that is seen in the column can be edited with the information pre-filled.
7. The tasks are draggable within columns
I am aware that there are still some cases that I intend to handle well.

Next Steps:
1. In Frontend, I want to add more screens such as Login, User Story, etc.
2. I will be making a backend for this as well and integrate it with this.
3. Create a better design structure, make it user-friendly and responsive.

I will be updating this code from time to time. See you around!
